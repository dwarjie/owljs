# Todo App using Owljs
The purpose of this exercise is for me to understand how Owljs works and basically my introduction to the Owl Framework.

Here's the link if you're interested: (Todo-App-Tutorial)[https://owl-docs.vercel.app/started/tutorial_todoapp#_top]

## What did I learn?
- How to use Owljs with Vite (since I'm more comfortable with Vite instead of webpack)
- Usage of the following:
  - ```mount```
  - ```Environment```
  - ```useState```
  - ```useRef```
  - ```xml```
  - ```onMounted```  
  - ```Props```
